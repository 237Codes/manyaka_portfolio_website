This is a document for my portfolio website. I will be documenting my progess here.

# Things to note about the experience section

When creating the experience section, I decided to try out the react verticale component
and I noticed a few things

1- The vertical component is hidden by default. I firstly tried to set <VerticalTimelineElement visible={true}>.
This creates a new problem which does not allow me do animations since I forced the timeline component to display
true, it display is always visible

# Making the projects clickable

To make the projects clickable so that I can redirect the user to another site, I will just need
to wrap them in an anchor tag
